I got frustrated by the lack of historical info on the official Heart Internet status page, so I set up my own version.

~~Github Pages take about 10 minutes to publish, so all the info is a few minutes out of date.~~

Having found [this article](http://christianheilmann.com/2010/01/10/loading-external-content-with-ajax-using-jquery-and-yql/) I reworked the page using [YQL](http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/) to reload more frequently.
